      <dt>EPUB 2</dt>
      <dd> this is a legacy format, only adequate for basic ebooks.
 Textual content is formatted in XHTML 1 and no multimedia feature is
 supported. EPUB 2 ebooks are still accessible if properly formatted.
</dd>
      <dt>EPUB 3</dt>
      <dd> this is the recommended format for the 21st century.
 Textual content is formatted in (X)HTML 5, it is possible to create
 fixed-layout ebooks, enriched ebooks and accessibiltiy features are well
 designed.
</dd>
      <dt>DAISY v2.02 / v3</dt>
      <dd>  (text, audio, text+audio).
</dd>
      <dt>PDF</dt>
      <dd> despite a well-known lack of flexibility (no reflow option)
 and accessibility, many ebooks are still available in PDF only, especially
 in public libraries.
</dd>
      <dt>Audiobooks</dt>
      <dd> a 
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/audiobooks/">standardized format for audiobooks</a >
 has been designed by the W3C Publishing Working Group in 2020, and EDRLab
 was part of this WG. Thorium is supporting the
 
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/lpf/">packaged (LPF)</a> audiobook format,
 which will soon be widely used by booksellers, or so we hope.

      </dd>
      <dt>Visual narratives</dt>
      <dd> EDRLab has designed a standard format for
 comics, manga, webtoons and other styles of digital works based on
 sequances of images.
 
        <a href="https://www.edrlab.org/open-standards/">Divina</a> is the name of
 this format. This is still an experimental format, and we hope that
 publishers will size it in 2021+.
