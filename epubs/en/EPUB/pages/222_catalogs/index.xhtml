    <p>Many public libraries and bookstores are adopting 

      <a href="https://opds.io/">OPDS</a> as a standard format to display their 
catalog on the Web. Thorium can provide access to OPDS 1 and 2 catalogs. 
It also supports several identification formats associated with OPDS 
and can therefore provide users with access to their personal library,  
i.e. the digital books that the user has acquired or 
borrowed, allowing them to be downloaded and read immediately.
  
    </p>
    <div class="info">
When you are in the Thorium library, select the 
`Catalogs` tab then the button `+ Add an OPDS feed`. 
Indicate a Name to designate this catalog and paste an address corresponding to 
to a catalog distributed in OPDS format. Validate with the button `Add`.

      <p>Example :</p>
      <p>Activating the following link will download a .atom file that can be opened with Thorium:

        <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search.opds/" target="_blank">Download OPDS feed for Gutenberg.org new titles</a>
      </p>
      <p>It is also possible to use context menu (usually Right clic), Copy this link and paste it into Thorium Add an OPDS panel
to see the magic happen.</p>
      <p>OPDS feeds can also be provided as direct links which should open directly in Thorium. 
        <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search.opds/" target="_blank">Open OPDS feed for Gutenberg.org new titles</a>
      </p>
      <p>Since Thorium 2.2, OPDS feeds can be edited so you can change the name or retrieve feed URL.</p>
